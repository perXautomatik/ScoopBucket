Scoop vs other package managers for Windows
-------------------------------------------

* **Doesn't pollute your path.** Scoop adds just one directory to your path, no matter how many apps you install with it.
* **Doesn't use NuGet.** NuGet helps manage library dependencies for software. Scoop doesn't try to stretch NuGet to doing something it was never designed to do.
* **Packages are easier to define.** Scoop packages can be written in JSON in any text editorâ€”nothing else needed.
* **Better interface.** Subjective, but true.
